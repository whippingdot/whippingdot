# Welcome!

Hi, I am Sanjaay, a.k.a whippingdot. I love to code and also love playing video games! My main focus is game dev right now. I am a very open person and am easy to talk to so create an issue on any repo of mine if you ever want to talk!

## Projects

- [Cricket-Attax](https://github.com/whippingdot/Cricket-Attax) - This is a cricket simulator with almost all features to make it as realistic as possible! It has an implemented draft system with special values for every batsman and bowler, making every single player unique. This provides strategy to the sim and makes it more fun to run through - you can learn the meta and get good.
- [Language-Tutorials](https://github.com/whippingdot/Language-Tutorials) - An old project of mine, this was my attempt at making tutorials for a variety of programming languages (and markdown) I am familiar with. I worked with several friends of mine to work on this but never was able to get too far ☹️

## Contact

### [ARCHIVED] Organization

Just here for memory's sake. Back in 2020 I started a GitHub organization for people who used to code on replit, back when it was known as repl.it and was much more beginner friendly. They used to have a good community there where posting and commenting on repls was allowed. The community formed and I decided to bring us together to work on projects, getting 30 people to join the organization. We worked on two major projects, divided into several teams for smaller projects, and most importantly had a lot of fun! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders)!
