## Starter Template
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Chips-game](https://github.com/whippingdot/Chips-game), a repo which is based on the game called chips. You can see the [project's README](https://github.com/CoderBoiis/Chips-game/blob/chips/README.md) and understand. Iâ€™m currently learning JS and CSS so I can master Web Dev. I am using LinkedIn learning to learn those! Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on this [AOC 2020](https://github.com/whippingdot/AOC-2020)! ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing rn. Ask me about C++ and Python, even HTML too. Just try not to ask __too__ *complicated* questions. How to reach me: create an [ask post on repl.it](https://repl.it/talk) mentioning me and your problem. If the problem is based on my repo then just create a discussion/issue. ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Little Brother, kid, whippingdot, Sunday, coder, and boi. âš¡ Fun fact: I am a human! Mind-blowing right? ðŸ¤¯
