I am a gamer/coder, meaning I like gaming, I like coding, and I want to be a game developer. I am a simple person, and maybe annoying too, though I hope not. I found GitHub not too long ago, but I forgot how. I ask many questions(meaning **many**) so try not to get **_too_** irritated. I also like usually browse the web for productivity tips and apps. BTW I know English, even though it isn't my mother tongue. I was born in USA and lived there for 8 years so ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰LES GOOO!

## Organization

I created a GitHub organization for people who use [replit](https://replit.com)(a browser IDE kind of website) [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders). We have 27 members(most members are private) and so I would say I did a good job advertising it and bringing people in. I really have to thank [replit](https://replit.com) though and this is the least I could do for them!

## Other things...

I discovered coding first when I got the Kano PC. It was a PC you could build and then use the Rasberry PI operating system on. Since then I started coding a lot and have improved considerably, being knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, JS, Nodejs, C++, and Python - but not excelent in those languages. I am still learning coding as I have a lot to improve. My goal as a developer is to do game development. I still think that goal is far off though as I am yet to learn C# or Unity...

## Contact

Contact me on replit by @ mentioning me. I also got discord recently, so you can find me by my tag 'Whippingdot#9819', but I currently do not allow friend requests and only I can give them for privacy reasons. You can contact me in an issue here if you want to talk to me on discord.
