## Ya BOI
I am a gamer/coder, meaning I like gaming, I like coding, and I want to be a game developer. I am not too new to GitHub, tho not too old too. Many 'too's. I ask many questions(meaning many) so try not to get ___too___ irritated. I also like doing random stuff to pass time when I can rather study hard to get good marks in my exams.

### Current project
I‚Äôm currently working on [Chips-game](https://github.com/whippingdot/Chips-game), a repo which is based on the game called chips. You can see the [project's README](https://github.com/CoderBoiis/Chips-game/blob/chips/README.md) to understand.
