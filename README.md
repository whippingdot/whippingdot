# Welcome!

Hi, I am Sanjaay, a.k.a whippingdot. I love to code and also love playing video games! My main focus is game dev right now. I am a very open person and am easy to talk to so create an issue on any repo of mine if you ever want to talk!

## Projects

- [Cricket-Attax](https://github.com/whippingdot/Cricket-Attax) - This is a cricket simulator with a lot of features to make it as realistic and intuitive as possible! Possibly my only major project so far, I am still working on this right now üòì
- [Language-Tutorials](https://github.com/whippingdot/Language-Tutorials) - An old project of mine, this was my attempt at making tutorials for a variety of programming languages (and markdown) I am familiar with. I worked with several friends of mine to work on this but never was able to get too far ‚òπÔ∏è

## Contact

### [ARCHIVED] Organization

Just here for memory's sake. Back in 2020 I started a GitHub organization for people who used to code on replit, back when it was known as repl.it and was much more beginner friendly. They used to have a good community there where posting and commenting on repls was allowed. The community formed and I decided to bring us together to work on projects, getting 30 people to join the organization. We worked on two major projects, divided into several teams for smaller projects, and most importantly had a lot of fun! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders)!
