# Hey!

I am Whippingdot, or maybe whippingdot or whip dot on several other websites. My real name is Sanjaay, and I like to code! I also play several video games, and have aspirations of creating a game development company in the future. I do talk a lot, sometimes make false promises (sorry), and get addicted to the internet with useless stuff. I am still in school too.

I hope to finish at least one project in Unreal by the end of the year. I have slowly stopped doing Web Design as it takes up unecessary time when I want to proceed with Game dev, and not Web dev. I still learnt those skills as they are useful in making websites, and potentially could be useful in the future.

## Organization

I created a GitHub organization for people who use [replit](https://replit.com)(a browser IDE kind of website) [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders). It died a long time ago, but I decided to revive it recently (wasn't able to do much progress as I have examinations). I might also do a rebrand to invite more people into the organization.

## Other things...

I discovered coding first when I got the Kano PC. It was a PC you could build and then use the Rasberry PI operating system on. Since then I found CodeAcademy, and then found replit. CodeAcademy helped me learn the basics of Python and C++, and was really useful. Because my dad works in Microsoft, I was able to get LinkedIn Learning for free too and was able to use that to continue with my coding learning journey. Replit was useful at first for creating all sorts of programs, but I shifted to VSCode soon after, and got really into it. A few months after that I learnt Vim and used that in VSCode too. I tried out VS for a while but it was too complicated and I didn't like the interace so I gave up on it. I still use replit today for creating and developing websites as hosting websites on replit is really simple. I also really like the community share feature as you can share your projects with the public and see user feedback.

## Contact

Contact me on replit by @ mentioning me. I also got discord recently, so you can find me by my tag 'Whippingdot#9819', but I currently do not allow friend requests and only I can give them for privacy reasons. You can contact me in an issue on this repo if you want to talk to me on discord.
