# Welcome!

Hi, I‚Äôm Sanjaay (whippingdot), a high school student and aspiring game developer with a passion for building interactive, attention-hooking projects. I love collaborating with others on any work so feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect or collaborate!

## Projects

- [Cricket-Attax](https://github.com/whippingdot/Cricket-Attax) - This is a cricket simulator with almost all features to make it as realistic as possible! It has an implemented draft system with special values for every batsman and bowler, making every single player unique. This provides strategy to the sim and makes it more fun to run through - you can learn the meta and get good.
- [TEDx@YouthCHIREC Website](https://github.com/tedxchirec/tedx-website-2025) - This is a website I developed along with another student for my school's TEDx@Youth event. We generated the design from magicpath and used that as our basis for the design. We followed a more spontaneous and creative coding approach for this project‚Äîcommonly referred to as ‚Äúvibe coding.‚Äù It was a fun, fast-paced way to build, but we also encountered the challenges it brought when scaling and debugging. This was also my first full nextjs and vercel project
- [Vulcan GP Website](https://github.com/whippingdot/vulcangp) - Vulcan GP is a STEM Racing team (F1 in Schools) that I am a part of. As the head of tech, I was tasked with developing the website. Coming right off of my TEDx website, I used the same workflow for this website so it was a breeze. The structure of the website was very similar to that as well so it wasn't too hard for me to develop it on my own. The development process helped me understand in even more depth why 'vibe coding' is useful for small projects but is much harder when scaling. It was a hassle bug fixing and making the AI do what I wanted it to  
- [Language-Tutorials](https://github.com/whippingdot/Language-Tutorials) - An old project of mine, this was my attempt at making tutorials for a variety of programming languages (and markdown) I am familiar with. Although the project didn‚Äôt progress as far as planned, it was a valuable experience in collaboration and documentation. It was also a delightful experience testing my knowledge by typing it out!

### [ARCHIVED] Organization

Just here for memory's sake. Back in 2020 I started a GitHub organization for people who used to code on replit, back when it was known as repl.it and was much more beginner friendly. They used to have a good community there where posting and commenting on repls was allowed. The community formed and I decided to bring us together to work on projects, getting 30 people to join the organization. We worked on two major projects, divided into several teams for smaller projects, and most importantly had a lot of fun! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders)!
