I am a gamer/coder, meaning I like gaming, I like coding, and I want to be a game developer. I am a simple person, and maybe annoying too, though I hope not. I found GitHub not too long ago, but I forgot how. I ask many questions(meaning **many**) so try not to get **_too_** irritated. I also like usually browse the web for productivity tips and apps. BTW I know English, and though it isn't my mother tongue, I was born in USA and lived there for 8 years so ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰LES GOOO!

## Organization

I created a GitHub organization for people who use [repl.it](https://repl.it)(a browser IDE kind of website) [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders). We have 27 members(most members are private) and so I would say I did a good job advertising it and bringing people in. I really have to thank [repl.it](https://repl.it) though and this is the least I could do for them! I LOVE REPL.IT HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY @replit get @ mentioned pls

YEEET I haven't updated this in a long time. Also most of the badges are innacurate...so ummm ignore it? ~~Lol~~ lul. Other things...i use the [replit-electron(currently)](https://github.com/replit-discord/repl-it-electron), ummm i found coding using the Kano PC, i am still learning coding ~~i am trash~~ i would say i am moderate. i have not yet made a good repl talk share post of a game **i have made myself** ~~i leach off of other peoples awesomeness~~. i would say i got friends ~~but they would say they don't~~. i created my own slang ~~which takes longer to write than normal english~~ and i am going to create a transalator for it ~~but i still haven't started the 'translating' part lul~~. I love strikethru and i hope my dad allows me to use discord cause i don't have it for now. contact me on repl.it by @ mentioning me ~~24/7~~. I hope repl talk EVOLVES. thanks @amasad for adding new updates regurarly ~~from recently~~. oi really appreciate it
