I am a gamer/coder, meaning I like gaming, I like coding, and I want to be a game developer. I am a simple person, and maybe annoying too, though I hope not. I am found GitHub not too long ago, but I forgot how. I ask many questions(meaning **many**) so try not to get **_too_** irritated. I also like usually browse the web for productivity tips and apps.

## Organization

I created a GitHub organization for people who use [repl.it](https://repl.it)(a browser IDE kind of website) [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders). We have 22/23 members(most members are private) and so I would say I did a good job advertising it and bringing people in. I really have to thank [repl.it](https://repl.it) though and this is the least I could do for them!
